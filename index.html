            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I first discovered computer science in a high school intro to computer science class, unheard of, I know. I had always been hesitant to try and learn programming because it looked complicated and seemed intimidating. Despite this, the class immediately became my favorite, combining the logical rules and operations that I loved in math and the creative problem solving that made sculpture and the arts exciting to me. This led me to pursue computer science further and I joined robotics. Additionally for the rest of highschool I took as many computer science courses as I could which included intro to computer science, AP computer science, Advanced mechatronics, and Advanced Python. By the end of high school my obsession with computer science was solidified and I decided to pursue a bachelors in it. The more I learn about different subfields of computer science such as cybersecurity, data science, web development, machine learning and system design, the more I am intrigued and excited to expand my knowledge.

                <br>
                I am currently a sophomore in Computer Science at Virginia tech. 
                Almost all aspects of computer science are fascinating to me but the topics on the edge of 
                human discovery such as machine learning and quantum computing are the most exciting to me. 
                I hope that after I graduate in May 2025 I will be able to contribute to fields like these in 
                a meaningful way and advance technology in ways that can positively impact people's lives. 
                Currently I'm a part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vtbolt.com/">BOLT</a> electric motorcycle design team. As a member of bolt I lead the gps project which aims to display the bikes position onto a map of the track and create data visualizations for the massive amount of race data we collect. 
                I've also worked on a few personal projects including a Discord chat bot which was built using Discord.py, a neural network built from scratch that was tested using a simple game built in <a target="_blank" href="https://unity.com/our-company">Unity</a> and a model
                weather alert system made using breadboards, electronics and an arduino.

            <h2>Flappy Bird Neural Network</h2>
            <p>
                I created a visually simplified version of the popular game "Flappy Bird" using C# to write scripts in Unity. I then used the game to test a Neural Network that I programmed from scratch also in C#. The highest score it has achieved so far is 6,216. On the left is the first few generations of Networks that gradually get better, playing at 8 times speed. I also uploaded the project to this <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dashiellbuddVT/FlappyBirdAI">github page</a> if you are interested in trying it out yourself.

            <h2>BOLT Motorcycle Race GPS</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently on the BOLT design team at VT which builds an electric motorcycle to compete in races. I'm apart of the controls subteam and currently leading the GPS project. The goal of the project is to create a live view of the bikes current position on the track as well as visualizing the data collected throughout the race. In addition to managing team members and keeping the project notebook up to date, I also contribute a lot to the project technically, most recently I worked on interfacing with the bikes sensor data.
